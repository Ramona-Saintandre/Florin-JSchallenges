// Lily likes to play games with integers. She has created a new game where she determines the difference between a number and its reverse. For instance, given the number 12, its reverse is 21. Their difference is 9. The number 120 reversed is 21, and their difference is 99.

// She decides to apply her game to decision making. She will look at a numbered range of days and will only go to a movie on a beautiful day.

// Given a range of numbered days,[i...j] and a number k, determine the number of days in the range that are beautiful. Beautiful numbers are defined as numbers where |i - reverse(i)| is evenly divisible by k. If a day's value is a beautiful number, it is a beautiful day. Print the number of beautiful days in the range.

// Function Description
// Create a beautifulDays function. It must return the number of beautiful days in the range.

// beautifulDays has the following parameters:

// i: the starting day number
// j: the ending day number
// k: the divisor
